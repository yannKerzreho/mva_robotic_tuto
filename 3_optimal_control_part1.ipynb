    "Robots are equipped with various actuators that receive inputs and sensors that provide outputs. A robot's computer faces the task of deciding what signals to send to the actuators based on the measured sensor readings such that a robot executes desired behavior. This task of controlling the robot must address various challenges such as measurement noise, inaccurate robot models, non-ideal actuators and external disturbances. Control theory offers a systematic approach to address this challenge. "

While this is often desirable, choosing $Q$ to be too high relative to $R$ can make the controller compute actions that exceed actuator limits and also makes it sensitive to process and measurement noise, which can result in a chattering behavior. Therefore an appropriate trade-off between control performance and robustness to noise and actuator limits needs to be made. The LQR controller can be computed using the following steps:\n",

    "## Optimal Control of Nonlinear System with Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The previously discussed LQR controller works with a linearized system and does not take into account actuator limits. Optimal control is a framework that allows us to handle nonlinear systems and constraints in a systematic way. In this exercise, we will formulate and solve an optimal control problem for the nonlinear cart-pole system using multiple-shooting formulation via CasADi. \n",
    "\n",
    "CasADi is a symbolic framework for automatic differentiation and numerical optimization. It is widely used in robotics and control for solving optimal control problems. It provides a user-friendly interface for defining optimization problems and constraints, and it can efficiently compute gradients and Hessians using automatic differentiation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To give a brief idea about CasADi's syntax, below is an example of a quadratic optimization problem with constraints. \n",

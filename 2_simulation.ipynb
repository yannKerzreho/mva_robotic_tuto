    "In this assignment, we will get a peek behind how robot dynamics simulators work. As mentioned in slide 14 of the [optimal control and simulation lecture slides](https://scaron.info/robotics-mva/slides/8-optimal-control.pdf), contact simulation (using time-stepping approach) involves three steps that are performed in a loop, namely 1) Collision Detection, 2) Collision Resolution, and 3) Time integration.\n",

    "This assignment uses the [Coal library](https://github.com/coal-library/coal) (formerly known as HPP-FCL), for performing collision detection, and the integration functions within Pinocchio for the time-stepping. You will implement the collision resolution part to compute the contact impulses to simulate frictional contact. "
